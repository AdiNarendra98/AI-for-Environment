# AI for Environment
- #### This repo was long-due which consists of all my **re-implementations, models for various papers and projects** that were created for a works in **AI Applications for Climate Change and Sustainability**.
- #### Most of them use data collected from Satellite and aerial Imagery. imagery systems like **Sentinel-2** etc.
