# River Network Extraction from Satellite Image using UNet

- This work presents an initial model for **detecting rivers and watersheds from satellite pictures** in this study, which was based on image processing methodology using **U-Net**.

## Dataset

- A collection of water bodies images captured by the **Sentinel-2 Satellite**. Each image comes with a black and white mask where white represents water and black represents something else but water. The masks were generated by calculating the **NWDI (Normalized Water Difference Index)** which is frequently used to detect and measure vegetation in satellite images, but a greater threshold was used to detect water bodies.
- Two different directories contain **2269 images** each where one represents original satellite images and the other masks generated images.

- Apart from that Data Augumentation was also done by **adding rotation techniques** to increase the size of the dataset. Using this method, the dataset can be increased from 2x to 4x. We are using **rotation angles of 90, 180, 270**.
