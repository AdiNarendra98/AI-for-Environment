## Methane-detection-from-hyperspectral-imagery
H-MRCNN introduces fast algorithms to analyze large-area hyper-spectral information and methods to autonomously represent and detect CH4 plumes. This repo contains 2 methods for processing different type of data, Single detector works on 4-channels data and Ensemble detectors works on 432-channels raw hyperspectral data recorded from AVIRIS-NG instrument.

#### Single-detector
Running single-detector is quite simple. Follow the [README.md](https://github.com/satish1901/Methane-detection-from-hyperspectral-imagery/blob/master/single_detector/README.md) in single_detector folder
```
single_detector/README.md
```

#### Ensemble-detector
For Running ensemble-detector we need some pre-processing. Follow the [README.md](https://github.com/satish1901/Methane-detection-from-hyperspectral-imagery/blob/master/ensemble_detectors/README.md) in emsemble_detector folder
```
