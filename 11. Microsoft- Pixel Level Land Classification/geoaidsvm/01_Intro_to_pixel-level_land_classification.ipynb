    "The notebooks in this folder contain a tutorial illustrating how to create a deep neural network model that accepts an aerial image as input and returns a land cover label (forested, water, etc.) for every pixel in the image and deploy it in ESRI's [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/) software. Microsoft's [Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) is used to train and evaluate the model on an [Azure Geo AI Data Science Virtual Machine](http://aka.ms/dsvm/GeoAI). The method shown here was developed in collaboration between the [Chesapeake Conservancy](http://chesapeakeconservancy.org/), [ESRI](https://www.esri.com), and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research/) as part of Microsoft's [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/aiforearth) initiative.\n",

The code, shell commands, trained models, and sample images provided here may prove helpful even if you prefer not to complete the tutorial: we have provided explanations and direct links to these materials where possible."

By expanding the training dataset and increasing the number of training epochs, we achieved results like the example at bottom right. The trained model is accurate enough to detect some features, like the small pond at top-center, that were not correctly annotated in the ground-truth labels.\n",
